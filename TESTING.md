 - Table 1


## Code Validation

### HTML

As recommended, [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) was used to validate HTML files.

| Directory | File | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| tournament/templates/tournament | new_list.html | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/home-w3c.png) | 1 error present on all pages - it comes from the fontawesome kit: transform: var(--fa-rotate-angle, none)|
| tournament/templates/tournament | tournament_list.html | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/tournamentsw3c-.png) | 1 error present on all pages - it comes from the fontawesome kit: transform: var(--fa-rotate-angle, none)|

While going through validation and testing I realised that I did not follow standard normalisation procedures, since I had used ID's to style different elements which makes it bad pratice, after that I fixed the html for the project thus resulting in only the problems mentioned above which one is just not adding the "<!DOCTYPE html>" tag on the validator, but ensured it is present on the document.

Below you will be able to see some of the problems that occured with duplication of ID. I also did not put assign an alt value to the images before. [bad practice html](documentation/testing/Duplication%20of%20ID.png)


### CSS

As recommended, [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) was used to validate the css file.


| Directory | File | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| static/css | style.css | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/css-w3c.png)| No errors |

### Python

As recommended by the programme, [PEP8 CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) was used for Python validation.
