# [FIRE TENNIS ACADEMY](https://tennis-academy-05aa7afa19fa.herokuapp.com/)

The Tennis Academy is a functional and educational platform that allows tennis lovers to share and exchange their passion for the game. Users can create their own unique member profiles to personalize their experience, connect with fellow players, and view relevant news updates. By offering users exposure to recent and upcoming tournaments, the Tennis Academy platform also facilitates tournament entry and tracking for players of varying skill levels. 

![Responsitivity Test](documentation/readme/amiresponsive.png)


## UX

In designing this website, I wanted to highlight my enthusiasm for tennis by creating a platform that highlights the sport's most important features. Especially more junior tennis players could truly benefit from the Tennis Academy platform, as it supplies the knowledge, community, and support needed in the early stages of joining the sport. 


### Landing Page

The platform's landing page serves to outline the Tennis Academyâ€™s purpose and display exciting and relevant news snippets and updates about the world of tennis. Users can easily navigate the website via the burger button in order to view other pages and access registration and login.

### Tournaments Page

The tournaments page, which can be accessed via the burger button, presents the most important upcoming tournaments. It includes a brief description of each tournament's history, dates, location, number of participants, surface of court, entry fee, prize money, sponsor, category, and number of players. When accessing the tournaments directly, users can find contact details for easy registration. 


### Registration and login pages
The registration and login pages welcome and guide users in the creation and usage of their unique member profiles. 

### Colour Scheme

The theme of orange, yellow, and light pastel colors helps accentuate the decorative tennis-themed header. Incorporating contrast in background and text colors was a helpful and fun stylistic tool to enhance user experience. The chosen [Color Palette](https://coolors.co/e24502-ffdab9-870703-d30cd5-860701 "Color Palette") was:

![Color Palette](documentation/readme/coolors.png)

- `#e24502` used for h1, borders, news, and tournaments text.
- `#ffdab9` used for the overall background.
- `#870703` used for title of news and tournaments.
- `#D30CD5` used for the profile user content.

- `blue` used for contact details.
- `black` used for text on tournaments page.
- `rgba(134, 7, 1, 0.5)` used for the navigation bar colours.



### Font families used

- Nike was used for the primary headers and titles.

- Luxia was used for all tournament descriptions

- Font Awesome icons were used for the icons for the home button, collapsible navigation bar, and footer.

## Database Mapping
Before starting the development, it is always good practice to map and design the database ERD, thus helping in the understanding and correlation of the different models.

```python
#STATUS will define the options for the different categories
STATUS = ((1, "8U"), (2, "10U"), (3, "11U"), (4, "12U"), (5, "14U"), (6, "16U"), (7, "18U"), (8, "Open"))
# Create your models here.
class WebUser(models.Model):
    """
    Stores a single user for the website, either staff or player
    """

    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    description = models.CharField(max_length=300)
    # tournament = models.ManyToManyField(Tournament, related_name="playing-tournaments", blank=True)
    created_on = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_on = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    # photo_url = models.CharField(max_length=500, blank=True)
    # photo = CloudinaryField('image', default='placeholder', blank=True)
    category = models.IntegerField(choices=STATUS, blank=True, null=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.first_name} {self.last_name} - {self.user}"



#This is the tournament model
class Tournament(models.Model):
"""
This model defines all the parameters for all the tournaments
"""
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100, unique=True)
    creator = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    start_date = models.DateField()
    end_date = models.DateField()
    location = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    surface = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    entry_fee = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    prize_money = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    sponsor = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    description = models.TextField(max_length=400)
    participants = models.ManyToManyField(WebUser, related_name="participatiing", blank=True)
    created_on = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True, null=True)
    updated_on = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True, null=True)
    max_participants = models.IntegerField()
    category = models.IntegerField(choices=STATUS, blank=True, null=True)
    img_url = CloudinaryField('image')
    phone_number = PhoneNumberField()
    email = models.EmailField()

    class Meta:
        ordering = ["start_date"]
        # permissions = [
        #     ("add_tournament", "Can add tournament"),
        #     # ("change_tournament", "Can change tournament"),
        #     # ("delete_tournament", "Can delete tournament"),
        # ]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.name} starts on {self.start_date} and ends on {self.end_date}, played on {self.surface} | sponsored by {self.sponsor}"
    
    def number_particitipating(self):
        return self.participants.count()

OPTIONS = ((0,"Draft"), (1, "Published"))
"""This model defines all parameters for the news."""
class New(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200, unique=True)
    creator = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    content = models.TextField(max_length=1000)
    created_on = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True, null=True)
    updated_on = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True, null=True)
    status = models.IntegerField(choices=OPTIONS, default=0)
    img_url = CloudinaryField('image')

    class Meta:
        ordering = ["updated_on"]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.title} was created on {self.created_on}. Last update {self.updated_on}"
```

By doing some research online, I came across [pygraphviz](hthttps://django-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/graph_models.htmltp:// "pygraphviz") and django extensions that allowed me to plot the ERD automatically, thus also making a clearer and more precise diagram.

![ERD](documentation/readme/erd.png)

## Agile Development Methodology
### GitHub
#### GitHub Projects

For this project, [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/users/bvelizmera/projects/3) was used as an Agile tool for this capstone project. Through the use of its interface it was possible to create a [Kanban board](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/boards#:~:text=A%20kanban%20board%20is%20an,order%20in%20their%20daily%20work.// "Kanban board"), thus allowing tracking of specifics tasks that must be completed.
![Kanban Board Project](documentation/readme/board.png)

#### GitHub Issues
GitHub Issues allowed me to use my template for user stories and thus manage the different user stories to tackle the specific tasks in hand and helping set goals.
There, I used my own **User Story Template** to manage user stories.


### MoSCoW method

The user stories were done and priotirised using this method, thus ensuring a successful product while also assuring quality and delivering features that add value to the development of the project.

## Testing
The testing can be seen on: [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) 


## Deployment
The final version and live site of this project was deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/ "Heroku") working together with GitHub to carry out the version control. 

To mirror the creation of this project, it is necessary to carry out the following steps:
1. Create an account on Heroku.
2. Create a new app choosing the correct region to.
3. Go to the settings tab of the new said chosen app and reveal config vars. These values are necessary and must match the values that you set on the project and your `env.py`. They are as follows:
	- SECRET_KEY
	- DATABASE_URL
	- CLOUDINARY_URL

4. GitHub account and repository must be linked together with Heroku to ensure a succesful deployment. [Here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration "Here") is the documentation.

5. Correct GitHub repository of the project must be selected

6. For a safer deployment, select manual deploy from branch, thus allowing to decide when to deploy the site.

7. The [app](https://tennis-academy-05aa7afa19fa.herokuapp.com/ "app") should be available now.
**Important:
	All packages on requirements.txt must be installed on Django using the command line ` pip install -r requirements.txt`
	Although whitenoise is installed to collectstatic files, it is advisable to collectstatic files manually to ensure a successful deployment. The command line is `python3 manage.py collectstatic`.
